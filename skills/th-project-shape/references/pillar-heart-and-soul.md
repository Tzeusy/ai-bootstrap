# Heart and Soul — Doctrine Layer Guide

## Purpose

The doctrine layer answers **WHY**: why this project exists, what it believes, what it refuses to be, and what principles constrain every decision. Doctrine is not aspirational — it's constitutional. It defines the magnetic field that aligns all other project artifacts.

## Recommended Structure

```
docs/heart-and-soul/
├── README.md          # Reading order, one-line per file, selection guide
├── vision.md          # Core thesis, what this IS and IS NOT, performance goals
├── architecture.md    # Structural philosophy (not implementation — that's RFCs)
├── v1.md              # Scope boundary: what ships, what defers, success criteria
└── [domain].md        # One file per domain that has non-negotiable principles
```

### Core Files (every project needs these)

**vision.md** — The thesis statement. Write this first. Must answer:
- What is this project? (one paragraph)
- What is it NOT? (equally important — prevents scope creep)
- What are the non-negotiable rules? (5-7 max, numbered)
- What does success look like?

**v1.md** — The scope boundary. Must answer:
- What does v1 ship? (explicit list)
- What does v1 defer? (explicit list with rationale)
- What are the platform targets?
- What are the success criteria?

### Domain Files (add as needed)

Add a domain file when a topic has principles that code must embody:

| Common domains | Content |
|----------------|---------|
| `security.md` | Trust model, auth philosophy, capability scopes |
| `privacy.md` | Data handling principles, user consent model |
| `failure.md` | Error philosophy, degradation strategy, recovery contracts |
| `validation.md` | Testing doctrine (what tests measure, not how) |
| `development.md` | Workflow principles, contribution model |
| `performance.md` | Latency budgets, resource constraints, scaling philosophy |

## Writing Doctrine

### Do

- State principles as constraints ("X must never Y", "Z always takes priority over W")
- Include anti-patterns (what NOT to do is as valuable as what to do)
- Number non-negotiable rules — they become anchors for design reviews
- Keep files self-contained — each file readable independently
- Write for a reader who has never seen the codebase

### Don't

- Include implementation details (that's RFCs/specs)
- List technologies or libraries (that's architecture docs)
- Write aspirational prose without testable constraints
- Mix doctrine with operational runbooks
- Exceed ~300 lines per file — split by domain instead

## Maturity Levels

| Level | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Absent | No vision, principles, or scope docs |
| Nascent | README has some philosophy but no dedicated folder |
| Structured | `docs/heart-and-soul/` exists with vision and scope |
| Mature | Complete doctrine, domain files, numbered rules, actively referenced by RFCs/specs |

## Evolution

Doctrine should be **slow to change** — it's constitutional. When doctrine evolves:
1. The change must be discussed and agreed (not unilateral)
2. All downstream artifacts (RFCs, specs) must be checked for alignment
3. The version history should be preserved (git is sufficient)
