# TH Engineering

Superskill router for the engineering quality bar. Ten subskills live under
`subskills/`, each a complete skill package. **Not** in the global
catalog — discover lazily, load **at most one** subskill body per
subdomain, and apply several in sequence in your own session when a task
spans them ("Subagent dispatch" says when delegating pays).

`/th-projects` governs the project (doctrine, specs, topology, audits);
`/th-tooling` governs this machine's harness (installed skills, dotfiles,
snapshot state); this superskill governs the change: the bar code must clear
while written, reviewed, or cleaned up.

## Discover subskills

```bash
PKG="$(dirname "<absolute-path-to-this-SKILL.md>")"
find "$PKG/subskills" -maxdepth 2 -name SKILL.md
rg -n "^name:|^description:" "$PKG"/subskills/*/SKILL.md
```

## Routing table

| Task intent | Subskill | Typical trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Holistic quality bar: default engineering biases, definition of done; the source projects' craft-and-care pillars adopt by reference. | [subskills/engineering-bar/SKILL.md](subskills/engineering-bar/SKILL.md) | "hold this to the engineering bar", "is this change complete" |
| Readability and maintainability: naming, function shape, abstraction altitude, comments, simplicity over cleverness. | [subskills/code-readability/SKILL.md](subskills/code-readability/SKILL.md) | "is this readable", "simplify this code" |
| Test quality: behavior-focused assertions, edge/failure coverage, regression tests, tautology and flake elimination. | [subskills/test-rigor/SKILL.md](subskills/test-rigor/SKILL.md) | "review these tests", "what coverage is missing" |
| Module boundaries and dependency chains: direction, layering, cycles, public surface, third-party policy. | [subskills/dependency-hygiene/SKILL.md](subskills/dependency-hygiene/SKILL.md) | "untangle these dependencies", "should we add this library" |
| Codebase documentation: synthesis, diagrams, contract-level code-cited facts, interface semantics cards, human-readable doc sites. | [subskills/documentation/SKILL.md](subskills/documentation/SKILL.md) | "document this service", "audit docs for stale claims" |
| Evidence bar for diagnosing hard bugs, flaky failures, and perf regressions: feedback loop, ranked hypotheses, tagged instrumentation, regression test at the correct seam. | [subskills/diagnosis/SKILL.md](subskills/diagnosis/SKILL.md) | "diagnose this", "fails one run in twenty", "find the regression" |
| Finish same-repo refactors/renames/migrations: delete lingering aliases, wrappers, fallbacks, dead flags. | [subskills/cruft-cleanup/SKILL.md](subskills/cruft-cleanup/SKILL.md) | "clean up this refactor", "old path still works" |
| Skill/superskill quality bar: triggers, grounding, metadata, routing, context efficiency, validation. | [subskills/skill-standards/SKILL.md](subskills/skill-standards/SKILL.md) | "review this skill", "should this be a superskill" |
| Scaffold or author a new skill end-to-end: init from template, bundle scripts/references/assets, package for distribution. | [subskills/skill-creator/SKILL.md](subskills/skill-creator/SKILL.md) | "create a new skill", "scaffold a skill", "package this skill" |
| Excalidraw diagrams into/out of workflows, architectures, protocols, Mermaid. | [subskills/excalidraw-diagram/SKILL.md](subskills/excalidraw-diagram/SKILL.md) | "draw a diagram", "convert this Mermaid" |

## Routing rules

- **Bar vs. subdomain**: holistic "is this good/done" → engineering-bar; an
  ask naming one subdomain → that subskill directly.
- **Change-level vs. project-level**: changes, diffs, PRs, modules → here.
  Repo-wide audits, specs, prioritization, knowledge architecture →
  `/th-projects` (whose craft-and-care pillar adopts engineering-bar by
  reference).
- **Build quality vs. product feel**: how the code is built → here; how the
  product feels to use (UX contracts, perceived latency, copy,
  discoverability, accessibility) → `/th-design`. A review that surfaces a
  user-facing feel finding routes it there instead of absorbing it.
- **Docs craft vs. knowledge architecture**: README/docs/doc-site quality →
  documentation (consumes excalidraw-diagram for its diagrams — an
  expected pairing); five-pillar shape work → `/th-projects`.
- **Skill content vs. harness state**: authoring a skill from scratch →
  skill-creator (then skill-standards before shipping); reviewing or
  auditing an existing one → skill-standards; whether installed skills are used, linked, fresh on
  this machine → `/th-tooling` (audit-skill-hygiene, refresh-snapshots).
- **Fallback**: quality-adjacent but no row fits → answer from router-level
  context or ask; don't load a subskill to browse.

## Subagent dispatch

Default inline. A sweep across several subdomains reads the same diff, so
one warm session applying each subskill in turn beats N cold subagents that
each re-read it at full price (cache-first rules:
[`beads-orchestration/references/token-efficiency.md`](../beads-orchestration/references/token-efficiency.md)).
Delegate only when one of these holds:

- **Independence**: the reviewer must not be the implementer. A
  fresh-context verifier catches what self-critique misses on high-risk
  changes.
- **Context isolation**: the scope would flood your context with material
  the rest of the task never needs (repo-wide sweep, large generated
  surface).
- **Iteration-heavy single subdomain** (excalidraw render loop, skill
  audit-and-fix): delegate the whole loop, review the returned artifact.

At most 3 subagent sessions in flight; meanwhile keep working on anything
that does not move the head under review. Each review prompt carries (1) the
absolute path to its `subskills/<name>/SKILL.md` with instruction to read
and apply it, (2) exact scope (diff, files, directories), (3) what the
result feeds and what done looks like, (4) the output contract: every
evidenced finding with file:line, severity, confidence, and a proposed fix,
or a clean verdict citing what was checked. The parent filters, dedupes,
and synthesizes; conflicts resolve via engineering-bar's biases. A loop
delegation states the artifact and its done-condition instead of (4).

## Shared invariants (all subskills)

- Quality claims are reviewable expectations, not taste: every finding cites
  file:line (or skill-path) evidence and the expectation it violates.
- engineering-bar's default biases are the baseline all subskills assume; a
  project's `about/craft-and-care/` overrides them where present.
- Fix-it-now beats file-it-away: the current implementation/recovery owner fixes
  small in-scope findings. Independent reviewers retain verifier ownership;
  new architecture, trust-boundary, contract, or risk-class findings return to
  `/th-projects` allocation/spec gates instead of silently expanding the diff.
- The owner's instructions outrank skill text: a subskill's bar shapes how
  work is done, not whether a direct request from the human owner (not a
  dispatching agent) is honored. Safety hard stops stay. When a gate here
  makes you pause, name the rule and its file.
- Reports and subagent briefs are written for a cold reader: outcome first,
  complete sentences, terms defined. The terse prose of these skill files
  is a loading-cost choice, not a template for deliverables.
- Subskills reference each other by relative path (`../engineering-bar/…`);
  those paths are package-internal and stable.
