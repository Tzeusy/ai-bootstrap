# Snapshot Flows Catalog

## Maintenance contract (read this first)

This is living state, not static guidance. When normal use surfaces a new
snapshot flow (any script or step that copies/links version-controlled
content into a runtime location), **append it here in the same change**.
When a flow's command or verification changes, update its entry. When a
flow is removed from the harness, note the removing commit and drop the
entry one revision later. Each entry records: what is snapshotted, refresh
command, verification, and last-verified date.

## 1. Shared skill views into tool homes

- **Snapshot**: source-directory symlinks at
  `ai-bootstrap/{.claude,.gemini,.gemini/antigravity}/skills/*`, plus a
  shallow generated wrapper directory at
  `ai-bootstrap/.codex/skills/<root-skill>/` for every Codex root entry.
- **Source**: `ai-bootstrap/scripts/link-ai-skills.sh`, invoked by
  `~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh` ("Linking shared AI skills" section).
  Discovery prunes `subskills/` (superskills install as one catalog entry)
  and `archive/` (retired skills stay cloned but unlinked), and skips names
  in the `skill_catalog_exclude` list (for skills inside upstream submodules
  that cannot be archived by `git mv`; currently `writing-skills`). Codex
  cannot use the direct directory symlinks because it follows them
  recursively during catalog discovery; its generated wrapper preserves the
  root frontmatter and directs Codex to read the canonical source. A
  format-and-source `.codex-skill-projection` marker plus the generated
  wrapper comment identify only those safe-to-refresh directories.
  Stale-removal otherwise touches only links into the canonical source tree;
  a colliding manual entry is preserved and makes the focused refresh fail
  explicitly rather than overwriting it.
- **Refresh**: `~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh` (full run is idempotent), or the
  focused command:

  ```bash
  ~/.dotfiles/ai-bootstrap/scripts/link-ai-skills.sh ~/.dotfiles/ai-bootstrap
  ```

- **Verify**: no broken direct links, and every Codex `SKILL.md` is exactly
  one directory below the catalog root:

  ```bash
  find ~/.dotfiles/ai-bootstrap/.claude/skills ~/.dotfiles/ai-bootstrap/.gemini/skills \
       ~/.dotfiles/ai-bootstrap/.gemini/antigravity/skills \
       -maxdepth 1 -xtype l

  codex_skills="$HOME/.dotfiles/ai-bootstrap/.codex/skills"
  while IFS= read -r -d '' skill_file; do
    skill_path="${skill_file#"$codex_skills"/}"
    case "$skill_path" in
      */SKILL.md)
        skill_dir="${skill_path%/SKILL.md}"
        case "$skill_dir" in */*) exit 1 ;; esac
        ;;
      *) exit 1 ;;
    esac
  done < <(find -L "$codex_skills" -type f -name SKILL.md -print0)
  ```

## 2. Git submodules

- **Snapshot**: submodule checkouts pinned to recorded pointers —
  `~/.dotfiles` records `ai-bootstrap`; `ai-bootstrap` records skill
  submodules (see its `.gitmodules`; archived ones live under
  `skills/archive/`) and `.claude/plugins/marketplaces/`.
- **Refresh** (to recorded pointer — safe):
  `git submodule update --init --recursive` in each repo.
- **Advance** (moves pointers):
  `git submodule update --remote <path>`, then commit the bump; in
  `~/.dotfiles` use the `Update ai-bootstrap pointer` message convention.
  Note: a full `bootstrap.sh` run advances all dotfiles submodules
  (`--remote` in its "Git Submodules" section) — a full bootstrap is a
  pointer-advancing operation, not just a restore.
- **Verify**: `git submodule status --recursive` shows no `-` (missing) or
  `+` (drifted from recorded pointer) prefixes you did not just create.

## 3. oh-my-zsh and custom plugin clones

- **Snapshot**: `~/.oh-my-zsh` framework plus custom plugin clones
  (`zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-syntax-highlighting` under
  `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`), installed by `bootstrap.sh` but updated
  out-of-band.
- **Refresh**: `omz update` (or `git -C ~/.oh-my-zsh pull`), then
  `git -C ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/<p> pull` per plugin.
- **Verify**: `zsh -ic exit` loads cleanly.
- **Last verified**: 2026-06-12

## 4. Vendored Excalidraw browser bundle

- **Snapshot**: `ai-bootstrap/skills/personal/th-engineering/subskills/excalidraw-diagram/references/vendor/excalidraw.bundle.mjs`
  (+ `excalidraw.bundle.version.json`), a minified build of
  `@excalidraw/excalidraw` used by that skill's local renderer.
- **Refresh**: `ai-bootstrap/scripts/refresh.sh`. This is an *advancing*
  operation (bundles `@latest` from npm, like submodule `--remote`) — run it
  only when the task asks for an upstream update, then commit the bundle and
  version file together.
- **Verify**: `cat .../references/vendor/excalidraw.bundle.version.json`
  shows the new version, and a sample render succeeds
  (`uv run <skill>/scripts/render_excalidraw.py <some>.excalidraw`).
- **Last verified**: 2026-06-12

## 5. Beads issue export

- **Snapshot**: `.beads/issues.jsonl` (passive export of the Dolt DB,
  regenerated automatically on `bd` writes; gitignored in these repos).
- **Refresh**: automatic; remote sync via `bd dolt push` / `bd dolt pull`.
- **Verify**: `bd doctor`.
