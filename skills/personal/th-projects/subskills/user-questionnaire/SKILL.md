  Use to accumulate genuine owner decisions into a local asynchronous review
  packet, walk the owner through that packet one question at a time, or route
  recorded signoffs through canonical owning workflows. Every problem
  scope and recommendation receives a separate adversarial verdict from an
  independent subagent against the target project's th-projects shape and
  th-engineering bar before it is review-ready. Triggers: "prepare decisions
  for me to review", "review when I wake up", "walk me through the blocked
  decisions", "collect owner signoffs", "decision packet", "questionnaire".

# User Questionnaire

Cross-cutting human-gate transport for `th-projects`. It turns already
identified hard owner decisions into a durable, resumable review surface. It
does **not** become a sixth planning authority: doctrine, specs, topology,
engineering standards, and the project tracker remain canonical.

## Admit only genuine owner gates

Before drafting, apply the target repository's decision-autonomy policy. In a
Beads-backed project, use `/beads-orchestration` to distinguish hard human gates
from ordinary engineering judgment. Admit a question only when a human must:

- adopt or change doctrine, policy, product scope, or an observable contract;
- record a decision that an owning operational workflow may later use to seek
  separately bounded external, privileged, destructive, costly, or live action;
- choose among materially different user outcomes with no governing answer; or
- supply unavailable owner-only information.

Do not questionnaire implementation details an agent can resolve from doctrine,
specs, evidence, and the engineering bar. Do not infer approval from silence.

## Build and review the packet

1. **Refresh the decision inventory.** Read the target project's local
   `th-projects` shape: heart-and-soul, governing RFC/spec, lay-and-land, and
   craft-and-care. Read the relevant tracker items and current implementation.
   Deduplicate by canonical decision or bead ID; record the evidence commit,
   timestamp, and anything live that was not inspected.
2. **Draft bounded items.** Copy
   [`assets/questionnaire-template.md`](assets/questionnaire-template.md). For
   each item, state one decision, 2-4 materially distinct options with pros and
   cons, a doctrine-grounded recommendation, and an exact authorization
   boundary. Follow [`references/packet-contract.md`](references/packet-contract.md).
3. **Dispatch an independent adversarial subagent per review batch.** Give the
   reviewer the draft items, source artifacts, and the target project's
   `th-projects` and `th-engineering` instructions—not the answer you hope to
   receive. The reviewer must issue a separate verdict for every item's
   **problem scope** and **recommendation**. Follow
   [`references/adversarial-review.md`](references/adversarial-review.md).
4. **Correct and re-review.** A material scope, option, recommendation, or
   authority-boundary correction returns that item to `Needs-rework`. It is not
   `Review-ready` until an independent subagent records `Pass` for both verdicts
   on the corrected artifact. If no subagent facility is available, leave it
   `Draft` and report the missing gate.
5. **Accumulate locally.** Write one local ignored `.md` packet unless the user
   names another location. Keep stable IDs and update in place so another agent
   can resume. Before writing under a Git worktree, verify the intended path
   with `git check-ignore --no-index --quiet -- <path>`; otherwise choose an
   ignored local directory or ask for one. Never place secrets, tokens, or
   owner-private values in it.
6. **Validate before handoff.** Run
   [`scripts/validate_questionnaire.py`](scripts/validate_questionnaire.py):

   ```bash
   QUESTIONNAIRE_SKILL_DIR="/absolute/path/to/loaded/th-projects/subskills/user-questionnaire"
   uv run "$QUESTIONNAIRE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/validate_questionnaire.py" \
     /absolute/path/to/packet.md --require-review-ready
   ```

   Resolve every error; the validator is structural evidence, not semantic
   review.

## Walk the owner through it

When the owner returns, load
[`references/interaction-and-application.md`](references/interaction-and-application.md).
Ask exactly one decision at a time in priority/dependency order. Lead with the
decision needed and recommendation, then give concise background and options
with pros/cons. Accept a letter, prose, an edited option, defer, or reject.
Refresh drift-prone evidence before presentation. Record actor/channel,
timestamp, exact or normalized answer, edits, post-answer review requirement,
authorization boundary, and destination workflow before advancing.

Never treat agreement to one item as approval of another. If fresh evidence
invalidates the framing, pause that item, revise it, and re-run adversarial
review instead of pressuring the owner to answer a stale question.

## Route recorded decisions

Route decisions only when the user explicitly asks. Re-read dependencies and
current heads first. The questionnaire itself never mutates specs, doctrine,
Beads, configuration, runtime, or external systems. Hand the exact decision
record to the canonical owning workflow—project-shape, feature-request/OpenSpec,
direction/Beads, or an operational protocol—and let that workflow enforce its
own review and mutation gates. No packet can release external/live action.

Use the apply checklist in
[`references/interaction-and-application.md`](references/interaction-and-application.md),
then mark each item `Applied`, `Held`, `Rejected`, or `Superseded` only from the
owning workflow's evidence. Keep implementation work in that normal workflow.

## Do not use when

- One fuzzy feature still needs shaping into a spec → `../project-feature-request/`.
- Competing work needs prioritization or Bead decomposition → `../project-direction/`.
- The request is merely to inspect or mutate Beads → `/beads-orchestration`.
- The agent can make the decision under the repository's autonomy contract.
- The user is present and asks one isolated, already-bounded question; answer it
  directly unless durable asynchronous accumulation adds value.
