# Project Shape

A project's **shape** = the knowledge architecture making it comprehensible to humans and LLMs. Not code — structured understanding of *what* a project is, *why* it exists, *how* it works, *where* it lives, *what* must be built, *who* you must be when you change it.

**Visualization**: prefer `/th-engineering` (excalidraw-diagram) + SVG render when supported and the diagram materially aids comprehension. Else fall back to Mermaid or prose. Never block shape work on diagram tooling.

## Sample triggers

- "Help me set up the docs structure for this project"
- "What's this project about / where should this idea be documented?"
- "Audit our documentation health — are the pillars coherent?"
- "Map this system's topology"

**Not for:** one concrete feature request (`../project-feature-request/` runs
the funnel); prioritization or "what next" (`../project-direction/`); scored
repo health audits (`../project-review/`); README/docs *craft* quality on a
single doc (`/th-engineering` documentation — this subskill owns where
knowledge lives, not how well one file reads).

## The Five-Pillar Model

Five distinct knowledge layers, each answering a different question:

| Pillar | Folder | Local Skill | Question | Content |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Doctrine** | `about/heart-and-soul/` | `heart-and-soul` | **WHY** does this exist? | Vision, principles, non-negotiables, scope boundaries, what it is NOT |
| **Design Contracts** | `about/legends-and-lore/` | `legends-and-lore` | **HOW** will it work? | RFCs, design docs, wire contracts, state machines, reviews, trade-offs |
| **Capability Specs** | `openspec/` | `spec-and-spine` | **WHAT** exactly must be built? | Normative requirements, WHEN/THEN scenarios, testable acceptance criteria |
| **Topology** | `about/lay-and-land/` | `lay-and-land` | **WHERE** does everything live and connect? | Component diagrams, dependency boundaries, data flow, deployment topology, integration maps |
| **Engineering Standards** | `about/craft-and-care/` | `craft-and-care` | **WHO ARE WE WHEN WE BUILD?** | Implementation quality bar, testing discipline, review expectations, observability, dependency hygiene, documentation, maintainability |

Four pillars live under `about/` (project self-knowledge, poetic names). `openspec/` stays at root — a product with its own structure/conventions.

Pillars form a **traceability chain** — Doctrine principle → RFC decision → Spec requirement → Code → Test. Topology cross-cuts all: *where* doctrine is embodied, contracts apply, specs are implemented, work lands. `craft-and-care` is the engineering-character cross-cut: who an engineer must be when changing this repo — explicit, careful, reviewable, observable, maintainable.

## Quick Start: Assess Shape

Run the scanner for a health report (which pillars exist, maturity, gaps):

```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/shape-scan.sh [project-root]
```

For scanner thresholds and conservative scoring rules, read [`references/maturity-rubric.md`](references/maturity-rubric.md) — load when interpreting a scan score or asked what counts as structured/shaped/mature.

If scanning is unavailable, check manually for each pillar:

1. **Doctrine?** — `about/heart-and-soul/`, `heart-and-soul/`, `vision.md`, `MANIFESTO.md`, `PHILOSOPHY.md`, or doctrine-like `README.md`
2. **Design contracts?** — `about/legends-and-lore/`, `docs/rfcs/`, `docs/adrs/`, numbered design docs, review rounds
3. **Specs?** — `openspec/`, `specs/`, `requirements/`, WHEN/THEN files, formal requirement IDs
4. **Topology?** — `about/lay-and-land/`, `maps/`, `architecture/`, component diagrams, deployment docs, `ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. **Engineering standards?** — `about/craft-and-care/`, `engineering-bar.md`, `testing-and-verification.md`, review/verification/observability standards, or quality doctrine scattered in contributor docs

Rate each: **absent** → **nascent** (scattered) → **structured** (dedicated folder, some coverage) → **mature** (comprehensive, traceable, maintained).

## Workflow 1: Bootstrap Shape (new project)

Bootstrapping is **consultative**, not template-filling. Extract shape from the human's head via structured dialogue, synthesis, adversarial review.

**Quality gates:**
- Most capable model, max thinking budget when available.
- Keep one bootstrap owner. Use one subagent per substantive, independently
  reviewable pillar cluster only when work partitions cleanly; group small
  adjacent docs so context and review overhead do not exceed the drafting work.
- Never self-review — independent review subagents when the environment supports them.
- Challenge the user — accept vague answers only to push deeper, never to ship.

**Fallback modes** (degrade presentation, not rigor):
- Full — highest model, independent review subagents, diagrams via `/th-engineering`.
- Lite — single agent + deliberate self-critique + user review when subagents unavailable.
- No-diagram — Mermaid or prose when diagram tooling unavailable.

**Process:**

1. **Interview** — Socratic extraction across five tracks (identity, boundaries, principles, architecture, contracts). Read [`references/consultative-bootstrapping.md`](references/consultative-bootstrapping.md) for question banks + challenge patterns.
2. **Synthesize** — distill answers into drafts. Use the human's own language.
   Make trade-offs explicit. Flag contradictions. Split to a pillar/doc-cluster
   worker only when the artifact is substantive and independently reviewable.
3. **Independent review** — fresh context reviews stable pillar/doc clusters;
   combine coherence + adversarial lenses unless risk warrants separate agents,
   then run cross-pillar review at convergence points. Read
   [`references/review-protocol.md`](references/review-protocol.md).
4. **Revise + present** — incorporate findings, present for validation. If "not quite right" → return to interview, don't patch.
5. **Scaffold + install** — run `shape-init.sh` for structure, populate with reviewed docs, install local skills. Vet generated pillar skills with `/th-engineering` (skill-standards) before relying on them.

**Pillar order** (top-down, each grounds the next): heart-and-soul → craft-and-care → legends-and-lore → openspec → lay-and-land. Draft `craft-and-care` right after doctrine is coherent, before implementation planning — mandatory for all non-trivial work. Topology can start in parallel with design contracts once the architecture interview track is done.

Read [`references/bootstrapping.md`](references/bootstrapping.md) for the phase-by-phase guide, including the local-skill authoring and skill-standards review loop.

## Workflow 2: Translate Ideas into Requirements

The shape model funnels ideas into code. Idea → doctrine gate → topology placement → design sketch → WHEN/THEN spec scenarios → tasks. Ideas enter fuzzy, exit precise; each pillar sharpens them; bad ideas die early on doctrine misalignment.

To run this funnel end-to-end for one concrete feature request, use [`../project-feature-request/SKILL.md`](../project-feature-request/SKILL.md). This section is the model it implements.

**When ideas don't fit:**
- Contradicts doctrine → reject, or evolve doctrine via
  [`references/doctrine-amendment.md`](references/doctrine-amendment.md) —
  drafted by agents, adopted only by the human owner, downstream sweep in the
  same session.
- No technical path → park; write exploratory RFC when a path emerges.
- Sound but not specifiable → too vague; break down further.

## Workflow 3: Audit and Maintain Shape Health

For an existing project, assess cross-pillar coherence and keep docs current.

**Assessment dimensions:**
1. **Coverage** — specs trace to RFC sections? RFCs align with doctrine?
2. **Freshness** — specs current with code? RFCs updated after implementation reveals design flaws?
3. **Gaps** — code with no spec? Specs with no doctrine? Design docs that never became specs?
4. **Orphans** — doctrine principles no RFC references; RFC sections no spec covers.
5. **Execution drift** — testing/observability/review/compatibility/documentation/dependency/maintenance standards out of sync with how the project is actually changed?

**Maintenance protocol** when code diverges from docs:
1. **Detect** — compare implementation against spec requirements, RFC contracts, doctrine.
2. **Update** — generate updated sections; group cohesive small edits and split
   only substantive, independently reviewable pillar clusters.
3. **Review the delta** — independent review agents on changed sections only.
4. **Cross-check** — cross-pillar review if changes affect multiple pillars.
5. **Present** — show diff + review summary before committing.

**Related:** [`../project-direction/SKILL.md`](../project-direction/SKILL.md) for full direction analysis with priority-weighted plans; [`../project-review/SKILL.md`](../project-review/SKILL.md) (spec-reconciliation mode) for detailed spec-code divergence; [`../project-feature-request/SKILL.md`](../project-feature-request/SKILL.md) for a single idea through the funnel.

## Workflow 4: Generate Project Overview

Synthesize pillars into a visual, layman-friendly `about/README.md` with embedded Excalidraw SVG diagrams — the public face of the project's shape.

**Requirements:** ≥2 pillars exist (heart-and-soul + one other); use
`/th-design` (information-design or accessibility) for the overview's human
reading experience when needed, and `/th-engineering` (excalidraw-diagram) only
when a diagram materially aids comprehension. Fall back to Mermaid/prose;
independent review when available, else explicit accessibility/adversarial
self-check + user validation.

**Process:** extract layman-relevant essence per pillar → design 3-5 diagrams arguing the project's story → generate via excalidraw-diagram + render SVG (render-view-fix loop) → write structured markdown (thesis → what it's not → how it works → v1 delivers → principles → navigating docs) → review (accessibility + adversarial subagents) → commit to `about/README.md`, sources in `about/assets/`.

Read [`references/generate-overview.md`](references/generate-overview.md) for diagram specs, document skeleton, review-agent prompts, and writing guidelines.

## Local Skill Installation

Each pillar gets a local navigation skill in `.claude/skills/` (and equivalents) — an **index with selection guidance**, not a copy of pillar content. It says *which file to read* for a task, not *what the file says*. Preferred path generates correctly-formatted skills:

```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/shape-init.sh [project-root] --skills-only --tools=claude,codex
```

All five pillars need one: `heart-and-soul`, `legends-and-lore`, `spec-and-spine`, `lay-and-land`, `craft-and-care`. For the manual path — per-pillar templates, the mandatory `name`/`description`-only frontmatter (scanner rejects extra keys), required progressive-discovery structure — read [`references/local-skill-templates.md`](references/local-skill-templates.md). After writing, validate with `scripts/shape-scan.sh` + `scripts/self-test.sh` + `scripts/eval-fallbacks.sh` and fix every reported issue before committing.

## Maintenance Expectations

- Keep metadata, scripts, and references consistent. If the model says "five pillars," adapters and companion files must too.
- Treat `shape-scan.sh` as an auditor, not a brochure — prefer conservative assessments.
- Re-run `scripts/self-test.sh` after changing `SKILL.md`, `shape-scan.sh`, or `shape-init.sh`.
- Re-run `scripts/eval-fallbacks.sh` after changing fallback-mode guidance or references.
- Keep `tests/fixtures/` aligned with real scanner behavior — they are package contract, not throwaway data.

## Anti-Patterns

- **README-as-doctrine** — README describes the project to users; doctrine defines what it *believes*. Don't conflate.
- **Monolith docs** — one giant ARCHITECTURE.md mixing vision/design/specs. Split into pillars.
- **Specs without doctrine** — requirements with no grounding get challenged endlessly. Doctrine ends debates.
- **Doctrine without specs** — principles that never become testable requirements. Specs make doctrine actionable.
- **Stale middle** — doctrine and code current, RFCs six months old. Design contracts must evolve.
- **Pillar without skill** — knowledge exists but agents can't find it. Install local skills.
- **Self-reviewed docs** — the LLM that wrote the doc reviews it in the same context. Use independent subagents.
- **Template-filling** — handing templates to the user instead of extracting shape through dialogue. Produces bureaucracy, not doctrine.
