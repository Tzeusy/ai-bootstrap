# Beads Writer

Create high-quality beads issues through repo-grounded research and deliberate field selection. This skill is a routing layer over the Beads operating model described in [`../../../README.md`](../../../README.md): issue writing should reinforce that workflow, not compete with it.

Every bead must be a self-contained handoff for a future independent session. Subbeads are not reminders; they must read like full standalone prompts, with enough context that a fresh session can execute them without the bead-creation chat.

## Use This Skill When

- A user asks to create one or more beads issues for a feature, bug, task, or backlog item
- A user wants a vague ask decomposed into actionable beads or an epic with child beads
- A discovered issue needs a proper bead instead of a quick title-only stub
- A backlog-grooming pass needs better scope, dependencies, or acceptance criteria

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- The work already exists as a well-formed bead and should now be implemented: use `beads-worker`
- The task is to review a whole repository or generate a roadmap from audit findings: use `project-review` or `project-direction`
- The task is exhaustive spec-versus-code reconciliation rather than issue writing: use `reconcile-spec-to-project`

## Core Rules

- Ground every bead in the target repo's actual code, naming, issue graph, and constraints before writing it.
- Prefer one bead per testable outcome. Split unrelated acceptance criteria.
- Keep epics focused: 3-7 children is usually the right range once overhead is counted.
- End every epic with a terminal reconciliation bead that depends on all implementation children.
- Use `bd create`, not `bd q`, when you need a real description.
- Do not pass dependency flags to `bd create`; create first, then wire with `bd dep add`.

## Read Order

| File | Read when | Content |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `references/workflow.md` | Every real use of this skill | Research-first workflow, decomposition rules, creation sequence, and verification flow |
| `references/fields-and-examples.md` | Crafting issue text or choosing fields | Field schema, type/priority guidance, and example beads |
| `references/reconciliation-beads.md` | Writing or checking an epic | Required reconciliation-bead contract, generation rules, and template |
| `references/quality-checklist.md` | Before finalizing or after creating beads | Final checklist, persistence checks, and anti-patterns |

## Trigger Sanity Check

- Should trigger: "Break this feature request into beads and make sure each child has enough context for a fresh worker."
- Should not trigger: "Implement bead `bd-123` in its assigned worktree."
