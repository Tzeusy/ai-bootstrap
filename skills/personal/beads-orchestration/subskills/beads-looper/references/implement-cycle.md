# Implementation owner cycle

The [delivery model](../../../references/delivery-model.md) owns package, branch,
packet and evidence policy. This cycle uses existing worker phases; it does not
introduce an alternate batch framework.

## Select and claim

Resume the owned outcome/package before looking elsewhere. Use the shared ranker
for its next runnable package or prerequisite. Inspect governing adoption, current
source assumptions, claims and rollback cohesion. Missing authority blocks its
dependent slice; missing packet content goes to bounded shaping, not silent scope
invention. For `scope:local-state`, require the owner's explicit request and keep
it out of ordinary isolated tracked-code delivery.

One member uses native atomic claim. Multiple existing beads use the shared
`delivery_package.py` claim command with a manifest and durable journal. Associate
the anchor/member metadata and persist packet/session/journal locator on anchor.
No second owner starts unless the complete package claim succeeds. Ordered internal
member dependencies are allowed; external/hard gates are not bypassed. Claim only
current bounded work, retaining outcome affinity without claiming future backlog.

## Work

Create/recover one `agent/<anchor>` worktree using `bd worktree create` from the
actual repository. Never move/edit the shared root checkout. Use
[worker phases](../../beads-worker/SKILL.md) with `ISSUE_ID=<anchor>` and optional
`DELIVERY_FILE`; bootstrap verifies actual cwd, Git identity and membership.
Read the concise current packet and referenced contracts, not the archive.

As implementation session, own code, focused tests, failure diagnosis and ordinary
corrections. As lifecycle holder, apply the resulting updates yourself at checkpoints;
dispatched workers instead report to their controller. Renew registry/liveness
without gratuitous note traffic. Publish useful commits and current recovery state.

## Independent review, once per content

Create or reuse one independent review record for the package anchor/PR. Only anchor
gets `external_ref=gh-pr:N`; members point to anchor, never duplicate unique refs.
The original→review dependency is only on anchor. A reviewer gets its own
`review/<review-id>` worktree at the published head and sends findings directly here.
An early verifier can be that same independent reviewer, not an additional compulsory
review layer. Same-content findings and evidence remain in the canonical record.

Keep implementation claims and worktree throughout review/CI. On corrections,
remove anchor→review dependency for correction work, leave review blocked and
resume this same session with existing PR/review IDs. Hard member gates remain.
Correct and push the same branch; restore the dependency and send changed head/content
and relevant test evidence to the same reviewer. No release to the global ready queue,
new correction bead, new owner or worktree transfer. A new trust/architecture/scope
choice still goes through its actual authority gate.

## Land and reconcile

Use the repository's review/check/merge queue policy and current owner-hold guard.
An independent reviewer may perform authorized merge; this owner confirms terminal
GitHub state and actual delivery base. Queue/CI waits retain owner affinity; don't
launch unrelated work just to occupy a slot.

Use structured member results and the helper's `closure-plan`, verify evidence and
landing then close only met members. A foundation merge leaves the original accepted
feature open. Unmet runtime/activation proof remains explicit in place. Review record
completion is distinct from every member being done.

If an optional tail blocks useful accepted source, publish and land a safe subset
through real gates; keep incomplete member/outcome state. Do not silently shrink
accepted scope or build another reconciliation hierarchy. On an external/hard gate,
name dependent scope and resume event, continue unaffected scope, then wait.

## Recovery or next package

Useful published branches remain recoverable; dirty/unpushed work is preserved or
quarantined, never removed merely because a PR opened. Follow helper journal recovery
for interrupted multi-claim attempts and guarded dead-owner adoption for session loss.
Clean worktrees/branches only after completed or explicit published handoff proof.
Retain this session for the next related package. On preemption/drift/stop publish
actor/session/packet/claim/review state and release or retain claims explicitly.
