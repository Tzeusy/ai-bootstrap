"""Rank ready Beads work in finish-first order for one or more coordinators.

Report-only: emits one compact `beads-work-queue/v2` JSON envelope and never
mutates Beads. `queue` is the capacity-bounded admission plan: P0 emergency,
review, retained-owner correction/resume, then new implementation. Complete
Step-0 normalization via `--review-state-file` is required for admissions;
without it only diagnostic `candidates` are available. The coordinator still applies the dispatch-readiness and
cohesion gates and claims atomically; losing a claim race requires refreshing
the queue. Every coordinator reading the same tracker gets the same order, so
parallel coordinators converge on the same epics instead of each opening its
own.

Usage (from the beads-coordinator package directory):

    uv run scripts/rank_ready_work.py --repo-root "$REPO_ROOT" \
        --coordinator "$COORDINATOR_ID" [--lanes N] [--scope-epic ID ...]

Ranking contract (canonical; `coordinator-loop.md` Step 2 only points here):

1. Urgent first: a runnable priority-0 bead, a ready bead under a priority-0
   ancestor, or the runnable blocker frontier of any live priority-0 task or
   outcome. Urgency ignores `--scope-epic`; held, unknown, or foreign-owned
   prerequisites never become runnable merely by inheritance.
2. Then work grouped by outcome. An outcome is a bead's nearest open ancestor
   epic, or the bead itself when it has none (a standalone bead is a one-bead
   outcome). Outcomes sort by:
   a. `focus` label on the epic or any ancestor epic (operator pin) first;
   b. effective priority, lower first. An epic holding a lane (a bead
      `in_progress`) counts one level more urgent than its priority, so it
      keeps its lanes against idle epics up to one level above it, but not
      against bigger gaps;
   c. epics already moving (a lane, a closed child, or a bead blocked on
      review with `gh-pr:<N>`) before untouched ones;
   d. fewest remaining beads (`total_children - closed_children`), so at
      equal effective priority the epic nearest completion wins even over
      one that holds a lane (Step 2's lane-epic affinity keeps a lane on its
      own epic);
   e. oldest creation, then id.
3. Within an outcome: prerequisites first (ready beads outside the epic that
   form the runnable frontier of its transitive blocker chain; they count as in scope when the epic
   is), then priority, then most dependents, then oldest.
4. Each epic puts at most `--max-lanes-per-epic` beads, minus the lanes it
   already holds, in the primary queue; a bead another outcome already queued
   does not use up that share. Its other ready beads append after every
   outcome's primary share, so no lane idles while ready work exists.

Capacity: the lane budget is global across coordinators: `--lanes`, else the
`beads.max_lanes` kv key, else 4. An in-progress package anchor or unpackaged
bead, including a reviewer, occupies one execution slot. Blocked/open owners
retain claims and outcome WIP but park execution; member in-progress flags
never override a parked anchor. A closed anchor conservatively falls back to
its pending members. Live registrations' `extra_lanes` reserve execution.
New outcomes also require free owned-WIP capacity under the same budget;
reviews and corrections reuse existing WIP. Running higher-priority work
consumes slots without idling the rest; unadmitted peer-owned higher work
requires owner resumption before unrelated admissions.
One emergency or runnable prerequisite of retained parked work may overflow
owned WIP by one when execution is free. At budget+1 no further overflow is
admitted, even if that extra package parks. Execution never exceeds budget.
Other `in_progress` assignees (humans) are counted under `other_claims` only.
In-progress claims whose assignee has no live registration are listed under
`unowned_claims`; their execution remains conservatively reserved until recovery.

Excluded from diagnostic candidates, with counts or ids in `excluded`:
- epics themselves; claiming a programme does not hide its runnable
  prerequisites or authorize parallel implementation of the same substrate;
- `pr-review`, `pr-review-task`, and legacy `review-correction` beads (their
  review/correction phase comes from normalized PR state and the receipt);
- `needs-shaping` beads (listed per epic, standalone ones by priority);
- `no-dispatch` beads (tracking or meta beads no lane works; counted) and
  `scope:local-state` beads (work on a checkout's gitignored state, which no
  worktree reaches; listed for the owner);
- beads with an assignee. Exceptions: an open bead assigned to `--coordinator`
  is queued (a release that kept the assignee), and an open bead whose
  `coordinator:` assignee has no live registration is listed as `stranded`
  for guarded recovery.

Blocked beads whose `coordinator:` assignee (any format, including
pre-registry `coordinator:<uuid>` ids) has no live registration are listed as
`orphaned_blocked`, each with `kind`: `pr` (it carries `gh-pr:<N>` or a review
label, so the review lane adopts it) or `gate` (blocked by status alone).

Also reported: `held` epics (progress or a pin, no runnable work, with what
they wait on), `childless_epics` for decomposition, and `closable_epics`
(every child closed; a candidate hint, never acceptance or activation proof).

Fail-closed: a failed `bd` command or unexpected output yields `status: fatal`
and no queue. bd older than 1.3 rejects `--brief` and fails this way. The
coordinator then dispatches nothing that wake (`coordinator-loop.md` Step 1).
