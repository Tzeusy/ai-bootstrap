# User Run

A handoff protocol for commands only the owner can run. Claude writes one
script per session, the owner runs it, and Claude reads its logs and carries
on without being told what happened.

## Use When

- A command fails for lack of privilege the session does not have: the
  docker socket, `/secrets/*`, another user's home, sudo.
- The owner offers to run something as `tze`, or asks for a `/user-run`.

Do not use it to get around a permission rule or a denied tool call. If the
owner did not offer to run it, ask first.

## Layout (fixed)

`<base>` is `$HOME/.tmp` of the Claude session user (`$USER_RUN_BASE`
overrides): **`/home/orca/.tmp`** for orca. Always write absolute paths in
the payload; never `~`, which expands to `/home/tze` there.

```
<base>/<slug>/
  run.sh                   harness + PAYLOAD heredoc
  .lock                    held while a run is in progress (one run at a time)
  <RUN_ID>.log             full stdout+stderr of one run (RUN_ID = YYYYmmddHHMMSS)
  <RUN_ID>.exit            exit code; absent if the run died
  <RUN_ID>.started         written once su succeeded and the payload began
  payload.<RUN_ID>.sh      the payload exactly as executed
  latest.log, latest.exit  symlinks to the newest run (latest.exit absent while running)
  artifacts/<RUN_ID>/      $ARTIFACTS for that run; artifacts/latest -> newest
```

The slug dir is mode 2770 and shares the session user's group (`orca`); tze
is in that group and the payload runs with umask 002, so both users can read
and write everything. Earlier runs' artifacts stay readable under
`artifacts/<RUN_ID>/` for a later payload to use.

## Procedure

1. **Pick the slug once per session**: `<topic>-<YYYYmmdd>`, e.g.
   `dev-rollout-20261009`. Reuse it for every later step in the session.
2. **Scaffold**: `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/scaffold.sh <slug>`. It is
   idempotent, never overwrites `run.sh`, and first prunes user-run state
   older than 7 days ([cleanup](#cleanup)).
3. **Write the payload.** Edit only the `PAYLOAD` heredoc in `run.sh`:
   - Keep the `set -euo pipefail` and `shopt -s inherit_errexit` lines (the
     latter makes `set -e` apply inside `$(…)`).
   - Use absolute paths and `cd` explicitly first: the starting directory is
     the owner's cwd when run directly, `/home/tze` under `su -`. Use
     `/home/tze/...` for tze's checkouts. No line may be exactly `PAYLOAD`;
     it ends the heredoc.
   - Stdin is `/dev/null`: nothing may wait for typed input except `sudo`,
     which prompts on the terminal. Use `--yes`/`-y` style flags. Pagers and
     colour are off (`PAGER=cat`, `GIT_PAGER=cat`, `SYSTEMD_PAGER=cat`,
     `NO_COLOR=1`); stdout may still be a terminal, so pass `--no-pager` or
     `--quiet` to tools that ignore those.
   - Write machine-readable results (tags, SHAs, JSON) to `"$ARTIFACTS/…"`, and
     `echo` a one-line `RESULT key=value` summary at the end.
   - Never print secrets. Load them with `set -a; . <envfile>; set +a` or
     `bws run`, and never echo them. The log is read back into Claude's context.
   - Don't leave background jobs attached to the output: the run does not end
     until they close it. Detach them with redirected output (`nohup … >file 2>&1 &`).
   - Make it rerunnable. On later steps, replace or extend the payload; earlier
     payloads stay as `payload.<RUN_ID>.sh`.
4. **Validate**: `bash -n run.sh`, and re-read the payload once.
5. **Present it** to the owner using the brief below, then stop and wait.
6. **When the owner says it ran**, run `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/status.sh <slug>`:
   it reports the state, the `RESULT` lines, the artifacts and the log tail.
   Read more of the log only if that is not enough. States:
   - `done exit=N`: the payload ran; N is its exit code (130 = Ctrl-C).
   - `not-started`: `su` failed (wrong password); the payload never ran.
   - `died`: no exit code (killed, or the terminal closed mid-run).
   - `running`: wait, or ask the owner.

   Then continue the task on your own. On failure, diagnose from the log,
   fix the payload, and present the delta. Re-present the whole brief only
   if the risk changed.

## Presentation brief (every time)

Lead with the command, then:

- **Command**: `bash <base>/<slug>/run.sh`, from the owner's own terminal.
  Running it as tze directly needs no password. Run as anyone else, it calls
  `su`, which needs a real terminal (the harness refuses without one).
  Claude Code's `!` prefix won't work: it runs as the session user, with no terminal.
  Mention when the payload calls `sudo`: expect a sudo password prompt too.
- **What it does, end to end**: each step in order, in plain words.
- **Side effects**: what changes outside `<base>/<slug>`: git state,
  registry pushes, cluster or DB writes, files in tze's home, system changes
  via sudo.
- **Risk**: low / medium / high, with one reason. Low means read-only or
  rerunnable and local. High means anything destructive, outward-facing or
  hard to undo; most `sudo` changes to the system are at least medium.
- **Time**: an estimate, plus what dominates it.
- **Rollback**: how to undo it, or "nothing to undo".
- **What I'll do next**: what Claude reads from the log and does after.

## Harness behaviour

- It impersonates `${USER_TO_IMPERSONATE:-tze}`. If the invoking user already
  is that user, it runs directly without a prompt. Otherwise it runs
  `su --pty - <user>`, which prompts on the terminal; Claude never sees the
  password. `--pty` matters: plain `su -c` starts a session without a
  controlling terminal, so `sudo` inside the payload could not prompt.
- The payload runs under that user's interactive shell (`$SHELL -ic`), so PATH
  from `~/.zshrc` applies (`(eval): can't change option: zle` lines in the log
  are harmless). A plain `su -c` misses it, which is how `bws` went missing on
  2026-10-09.
- One `tee` captures everything, including the payload's stderr, with start
  and end markers and the exit code. Ctrl-C, TERM and hangup are noted in the
  log and the payload's own exit code is recorded (130 unless the payload
  traps the signal). Under `su --pty` the log has CRLF line endings;
  `status.sh` strips them.
- A second run of the same slug while one is in progress is refused. The
  whole harness is parsed before it runs, so editing `run.sh` mid-run is
  safe and takes effect on the next run.
- It refuses early, with a reason, when the slug dir is not writable by the
  invoker, the target user does not exist, `su` would have no terminal, the
  payload can't be written in full (disk full), or the payload has a syntax
  error.

## Cleanup

`scripts/cleanup.sh [--days N] [--dry-run]` (scaffold runs it with the
default 7 days) removes, under `<base>`, slug dirs with no file modified in N
days, and older runs (log, exit, payload copy, artifacts) inside live slug
dirs, always keeping the latest run. It touches only dirs whose `run.sh`
carries the `# user-run:` header, and holds each slug's lock while pruning
it: it skips a run in progress, and a run started meanwhile is refused. Files the
payload left without group write permission can't be removed; it reports
them, keeps `run.sh` so the next cleanup retries, and carries on.

## Tests

`tests/harness.sh` runs the harness end to end in a throwaway dir (direct
branch only; `su --pty` needs a password). Run it after changing the
template or scripts.

## Template

[`assets/run.sh.template`](assets/run.sh.template) is the harness. Change the
template, not individual run scripts, when the harness itself needs to change.
Existing `run.sh` files keep the harness they were scaffolded with.
